### Environment Variables
**Backend**
- Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
- Add the following variables with appropriate values
```bash
# Database connection string
MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name"

# Frontend URL (adjust if needed)
ORIGIN="http://localhost:3000"

# Email credentials for sending password resets and OTPs
EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
PASSWORD="your-email-password"

# Token and cookie expiration settings
LOGIN_TOKEN_EXPIRATION="30d"  # Days
OTP_EXPIRATION_TIME="120000"  # Milliseconds
PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_EXPIRATION="2m"  # Minutes
COOKIE_EXPIRATION_DAYS="30"    # Days

# Secret key for jwt security
SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"

# Environment (production/development)
PRODUCTION="false" # Initially set to false for development
```

**Frontend**
- Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory
- Add the following variable:
```bash
# Backend URL (adjust if needed)
REACT_APP_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000" 
```

**Important**
- Replace all placeholders (e.g., your_database_name, your_email) with your actual values.
- Exclude the `.env` file from version control to protect sensitive information.

### Data seeding
- **Get started quickly with pre-populated data**: Populate your database with sample users, products, reviews, and carts, enabling you to test functionalities without manual data entry.

**Steps**:
- Open a new terminal window.
- Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
- Run the seeding script: `npm run seed` ( This script executes the `seed.js` file within the `seed` subdirectory equivalent to running `node seed/seed.js` )
### Running Development Servers

**Important:**

- **Separate terminals**: Run the commands in separate terminal windows or use `split terminal` to avoid conflicts.


#### Start the backend server
- Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
- Start the server: `npm run dev` (or npm start)
- You should see a message indicating the server is running, usually on port 8000.
     
#### Start the frontend server:
- Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
- Start the server: `npm start`
- You should see a message indicating the server is running, usually on port 3000.

### Login with demo account (Optional)
- After successfully seeding the database, you can now explore the application's functionalities using pre-populated sample data.
- here are the `login credentials`
```bash
  email: demo@gmail.com
  pass: helloWorld@123
```

- **Please Note**: While the demo account provides a convenient way to explore many features, it has some limitations:
    - **Password Reset and OTP Verification**: Due to security reasons, the demo account uses a non-real email address. Therefore, password reset and OTP verification functionalities are not available for this account.

    **What this means**:
    - You cannot request a password reset or receive verification codes on the demo email address.
    - To test password reset and OTP verification flows, you need to create a genuine account with a valid email address.

    **What to do?**
    - If you're primarily interested in exploring other functionalities like wishlist, cart, and order history, the demo account is sufficient.
    - To test password reset and OTP verification, create a personal account with a valid email address.
### Accessing the Application
Once both servers are running, you can access them at the following URL's:
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
